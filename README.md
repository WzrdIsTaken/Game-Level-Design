This was my second time using Unreal, and by the end of this project I feel like I have a decent understanding about how to use the engine and its blueprinting system. While the end code / project structure result in this assignment isn't the best, I learned iteratively and so if I were to begin a new project I could apply the lessons and create something a lot more solid. <br>
